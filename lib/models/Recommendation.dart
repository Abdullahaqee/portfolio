He is hardworking and makes it so easy to transcribe ideas into beautiful and testable flutter apps. He is a Flutter/Dart gem and has my highest recommendation",

It will be great if you add some comments to your steps with 0.5 seconds pause before implementing this step. By meaning of steps, I mean not the basic, but structural steps, like 10-20 steps per video. However, thank you very much!",
